            The Perry family story begins with two families who journeyed from
            Europe to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula – and continues across
            generations, states, and even continents.

                William Henry Perry Sr. was the son of Cornish immigrants who
                came to the U.P. seeking work and opportunity. Irene Marie
                (Hakala) Perry was the daughter of Finnish immigrants who also
                made their home in Michigan.
              </p>
              <p class="card__body">
                Together, William and Irene raised
                <strong>nine children</strong> between 1939 and 1952, most of
                whom, along with many grandchildren, spent their early years in
                Michigan.

                Over time, work, school, and family led the Perry descendants
                far beyond Michigan – including Missouri and overseas. Today our
                family includes children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren,
                and great-great-grandsons who live in different states and
                countries.

                This reunion is a chance to reconnect, put faces to names, and
                introduce the newest branches of the family tree – including
                little ones and relatives some of us may be meeting for the very
                first time.

            family fit together. It’s not a full genealogy chart, but it helps
            everyone see where they connect in the family story.
