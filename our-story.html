            The Perry family story begins with two families who journeyed from
            Europe to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula – and continues across
            generations, states, and even continents.

                William Henry Perry Sr. was the son of Cornish immigrants who
                came to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan seeking work and
                opportunity. Irene “Irja” Marie (Hakala) Perry was the daughter
                of Finnish immigrants who also made their home in the U.P.
              </p>
              <p class="card__body">
                Together, William and Irene raised
                <strong>nine children</strong> in Michigan. Many of those
                children then raised their own families there as well.

                Over time, work, school, and family led the Perry descendants
                far beyond Michigan – including California, Florida, Illinois,
                Missouri, Washington, Wisconsin, and overseas. Today our family
                includes children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and
                great-great-grandchildren who live in different states and
                countries.

                This reunion is a chance to reconnect, put faces to names, and
                introduce the newest branches of the family tree – including
                little ones and relatives some of us may be meeting for the very
                first time.

            everyone see where they connect in the family story. If you spot
            something we’ve missed, please let Sarah know so we can keep this up
            to date.

                On William’s side, the story starts with
                <strong>Andrew Stevens Perry</strong> and
                <strong>Annie (Perry) Perry</strong>. Andrew was born in Lelant,
                Cornwall, and came to the U.S. as a teenager, working first in
                Pennsylvania coal country and later in the iron mines of
                Michigan and Wisconsin. Annie was born in Carmel, New York, and
                grew up in Crystal Falls, Michigan. Together they raised their
                family in mining locations across the Upper Peninsula.

                On Irene’s side, our Finnish roots come from
                <strong>Jacob Nestor Hakala</strong> and
                <strong>Maria Eliina (Oja) Hakala</strong>. Jacob was born in
                Kauhajoki, Finland, and Maria in Finland as well, before their
                families settled in the Princeton and Forsyth Township area of
                Marquette County. They combined small farms with iron-mine work
                along Highway M-35 and raised a large family of Hakala children
                who carried Finnish traditions into the next generation.
