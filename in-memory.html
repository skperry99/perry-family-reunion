            <h3 class="card__title">William &amp; Irene Perry</h3>
            <p class="card__body">
              <strong>William Henry Perry Sr.</strong> (1910–1970) was born in
              Crystal Falls, Michigan, the son of Cornish immigrants
              <strong>Andrew Stevens Perry</strong> and
              <strong>Annie (Perry) Perry</strong>. He grew up in the mining
              locations of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and spent much of his
              working life in and around the iron ore mines near Ishpeming and
              Negaunee, first as a blacksmith and later as a pumpman. In his
              later years, William and Irene moved to the Farwell, Michigan
              area, where they ran a small gas station and store near a lake
              that the oldest grandchildren remember visiting.
            </p>
            <p class="card__body">
              <strong>Irene “Irja” Marie (Hakala) Perry</strong> (1911–2006) was
              born <strong>Irja Maria Hakala</strong> in the Princeton Location
              near Ishpeming, Michigan, to Finnish immigrants
              <strong>Jacob Nestor Hakala</strong> and
              <strong>Maria Eliina (Oja) Hakala</strong>. She grew up in a large
              Finnish-American family in the Forsyth/Princeton area, one of nine
              children on a small farm and mining-location community. When she
              started school, her given name “Irja” was anglicized to “Irene,”
              and that is how most of us knew her for the rest of her life.
              William and Irene married in October 1939 in Ishpeming and went on
              to raise nine children. In later years Irene lived in Midland,
              Pinckneyville, and Lansing, often sharing a home with her children
              and grandchildren, keeping the heart of the Perry family together
              even as it spread from Michigan to Missouri, Florida, and beyond.

              <p class="card__body">
                Born in Ishpeming in 1939, and the eldest of William and Irene’s
                nine children, Bill grew up in the U.P. before later making his
                home in Midland, Michigan. He worked for Dow Chemical as a
                pipefitter/multi-craftsman for 30 years, where coworkers knew
                him as “the Admiral.” After retiring, he continued to work
                part-time and remained active at Trinity Lutheran Church. He was
                known for his quiet humor, steady presence, and deep devotion to
                his wife, children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.

              <p class="card__body">
                John was born in Negaunee, Michigan, and carried his U.P. roots
                with him through a life that eventually led to Maryland Heights,
                Missouri. He was a son, brother, dad, grandpa, and uncle, and
                his life bridged Michigan, Illinois, and Missouri. John had a
                quick wit and a gift for storytelling, especially about growing
                up in National Mine and the U.P. At our 2026 reunion we’ll
                gather for a Celebration of Life to share stories, photos, and
                memories of John and the many ways he made us laugh and feel at
                home.

                Garry built a career as a certified public accountant in
                Florida, spending more than two decades with a Lakeland CPA firm
                before moving to Illinois to serve as chief financial officer
                for his brother’s company. He made his home in Tampa with his
                wife and their children. Garry is remembered for his work ethic,
                dry wit, and love for his extended family, and for keeping close
                ties with his Michigan roots even while living in the sunshine.

                Liz was born in September 1950 in Ishpeming and grew up in
                National Mine as the second youngest Perry sibling. As an adult
                she spent many years in Pinckneyville, Illinois, later living in
                the St. Louis area and in Lansing, Michigan. She often shared
                her home with family, including her mother, Irene, and played a
                big role in helping care for her in later years. Liz is
                remembered as a loving daughter, sister, aunt, and friend, and
                we honor her alongside her parents and brothers.
