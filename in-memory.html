            As we gather for the first Perry Family Reunion, we also hold close
            the family members who are no longer with us. Their stories, humor,
            hard work, and love helped shape who we are today.

              This page is a small way to honor them. During the reunion, we’ll
              have additional space to share memories, photos, and stories
              together.

              <h2 class="card__title">Irja “Irene” M. (Hakala) Perry</h2>
              <p class="card__body">
                Irja “Irene” Marie Hakala Perry was born on
                <strong>February 4, 1911</strong> in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula,
                the daughter of Finnish immigrants Jacob and Maria (Oja) Hakala.
                She married <strong>William Henry Perry</strong> in October
                1939, and together they raised nine children and built a life
                rooted in faith, family, and hard work in the U.P.
              </p>
              <p class="card__body">
                Irene lived a long life, passing away at the age of 95 on March
                30, 2006, surrounded by family. The values she carried from her
                Finnish upbringing—perseverance, hospitality, and quiet
                strength—still ripple through her children, grandchildren, and
                great-grandchildren.
              </p>
              <p class="card__body">
                At the reunion, we remember her as “Mom,” “Grandma,” and
                “Great-Grandma Irene,” whose kitchen, stories, and hugs were at
                the center of so many early Perry memories.

              <h2 class="card__title">John Alan Perry</h2>
              <p class="card__body">
                <strong>John Alan Perry</strong>, one of William and Irene’s
                sons, was born on <strong>November 28, 1942</strong>, in
                Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. He passed away on
                <strong>September 20, 2025</strong>, at the age of 82, in
                Maryland Heights, Missouri.
              </p>
              <p class="card__body">
                John was a son, brother, dad, grandpa, and friend. For many of
                us, he is remembered for his wit, his stories, and the way he
                could fill a room with conversation. His life connected the U.P.
                roots of the Perry family to later chapters in Illinois and
                Missouri, and to children and grandchildren who carry his memory
                forward.
              </p>
              <p class="card__body">
                During the reunion weekend, we will set aside time for a
                <strong>Celebration of Life</strong> in John’s honor, along with
                time to remember other loved ones who have passed. This will be
                a space for stories, photos, and quiet moments of gratitude.

              In addition to John and Irene, four of the nine Perry children and
              many other relatives have passed away over the years. Each of
              them—parents, siblings, cousins, spouses, and friends—has left an
              imprint on our family.
