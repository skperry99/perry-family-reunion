            <p class="card__body">
              <strong>William Henry Perry Sr.</strong> (1910–1970) was born in
              Crystal Falls, Michigan, the son of Cornish immigrants Andrew and
              Anna Perry. He worked in the Upper Peninsula mining industry and
              made his home in Ishpeming.

            <p class="card__body">
              <strong>Irja “Irene” M. (Hakala) Perry</strong> (1911–2006) was born
              in Princeton Location, Michigan, to Finnish immigrants Jacob and
              Maria (Oja) Hakala. William and Irene married in October 1939 in
              Ishpeming and went on to raise nine children between 1939 and 1952.
              Their family later spread from Michigan to Missouri, Florida, and
              beyond, but the roots trace back to their home in the U.P.

                Born in Ishpeming and raised in the U.P., Bill later made his home
                in Midland, Michigan. He worked for Dow Chemical as a
                pipefitter/multi-craftsman for 30 years, where coworkers knew him
                as “the Admiral.” After retiring, he continued to work part-time
                and remained active at Trinity Lutheran Church. He was known for
                his quiet humor, steady presence, and deep devotion to his wife,
                children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.

              <p class="card__body">
                John was born in Negaunee, Michigan, and carried his U.P. roots
                with him through a life that eventually led to Maryland Heights,
                Missouri. He was a son, brother, dad, grandpa, and uncle, and his
                life bridged Michigan, Illinois, and Missouri. At our 2026
                reunion we’ll gather for a Celebration of Life to share stories,
                photos, and memories of John and the many ways he made us laugh
                and feel at home.

                Liz was born in 1950 and spent much of her life in Michigan,
                later living in Lansing. She is remembered as a loving daughter,
                sister, aunt, and friend. Though some of us knew her well and
                others only through stories, her place in the Perry family tree is
                cherished, and we honor her memory alongside her parents and
                brothers.
