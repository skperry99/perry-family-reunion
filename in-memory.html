            <p class="card__body">
              <strong>William Henry Perry Sr.</strong> (1910–1970) was born in
              Crystal Falls, Michigan, the son of Cornish immigrants Andrew and
              Anna Perry. He worked in the Upper Peninsula mining industry and
              made his home in Ishpeming.

            <p class="card__body">
              <strong>Irja “Irene” M. (Hakala) Perry</strong> (1911–2006) was
              born in Princeton Location, Michigan, to Finnish immigrants Jacob
              and Maria (Oja) Hakala. William and Irene married in October 1939
              in Ishpeming and went on to raise nine children between 1939 and
              1952. Their family later spread from Michigan to Missouri,
              Florida, and beyond, but the roots trace back to their home in the
              U.P.

                Born in Ishpeming and raised in the U.P., Bill later made his
                home in Midland, Michigan. He worked for Dow Chemical as a
                pipefitter/multi-craftsman for 30 years, where coworkers knew
                him as “the Admiral.” After retiring, he continued to work
                part-time and remained active at Trinity Lutheran Church. He was
                known for his quiet humor, steady presence, and deep devotion to
                his wife, children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.

                Garry built a career as a certified public accountant in
                Florida, spending more than two decades with a Lakeland CPA firm
                before moving to Illinois to serve as chief financial officer
                for his brother’s company. He made his home in Tampa with his
                wife, Kathy, and their children, Kirstan and Schaler. Garry is
                remembered for his work ethic, dry wit, and love for his family.

              <p class="card__body">
                John was born in Negaunee, Michigan, and carried his U.P. roots
                with him through a life that eventually led to Maryland Heights,
                Missouri. He was a son, brother, dad, grandpa, and uncle, and
                his life bridged Michigan, Illinois, and Missouri. At our 2026
                reunion we’ll gather for a Celebration of Life to share stories,
                photos, and memories of John and the many ways he made us laugh
                and feel at home.

                Liz was born in 1950 and spent much of her life in Michigan,
                later living in Lansing. She is remembered as a loving daughter,
                sister, aunt, and friend. Though some of us knew her well and
                others only through stories, her place in the Perry family tree
                is cherished, and we honor her memory alongside her parents and
                brothers.

              This is only a beginning. If you would like a specific loved one
              honored by name or photo, please reach out to Sarah. We can
              include them in the Celebration of Life, the slideshow, or a
              memory area at the reunion so that every branch of the family tree
              is represented.

              If you only have printed photos, you can bring them to the reunion
