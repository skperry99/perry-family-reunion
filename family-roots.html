            <p>
              <strong>William Henry Perry Sr.</strong> was born 31 March 1910 in
              Crystal Falls, Iron County, Michigan, the son of
              <strong>Andrew Stevens Perry</strong> (1886–1940) and
              <strong>Annie (Perry) Perry</strong> (1888–1967). He grew up in
              mining communities in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, including
              Crystal Falls, the company village of Alpha, and later locations
              near Spurr Township and Ishpeming.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a young man William followed his father into the mines. In the
              1930 census he appears at the Imperial Mine Location in Spurr
              Township, Baraga County, living with his parents and siblings and
              working in the iron-ore district. By the late 1930s he was in
              Ishpeming, Marquette County, employed in the local mines and
              boarding with his parents on Excelsior Street.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Irene Marie (Irja / Irria Maria) Hakala</strong> was born
              4 February 1911 at Princeton Location in Forsyth Township,
              Marquette County, Michigan. Her birth certificate records her as
              <em>Irria Maria Hakala</em>, daughter of
              <strong>Jacob Nestor Hakala</strong> (1887–1957) and
              <strong>Maria Eliina (Eliina / Elina) Oja</strong> (1891–1955),
              both Finnish immigrants who had settled in the Princeton and
              Forsyth farming district along what is now Highway M-35.
            </p>

            <p>
              On 11 October 1939, William and Irene were married in Ishpeming,
              Michigan. Their marriage record lists Irene as a resident of
              Princeton and William as a resident of Ishpeming, with Roy
              Anderson and Irene’s sister Ellen Hakala as witnesses. Shortly
              after their marriage they lived with William’s parents at
              <strong>140 Excelsior Street in Ishpeming</strong>, where the
              1940 census shows William working as a miner, Irene as a
              homemaker, and baby William Jr. as a seven-month-old.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the 1940s and 1950s the family moved a short distance to rural
              Ely Township, Marquette County. The 1950 census lists William as a
              <strong>pumpman in an iron-ore mine</strong>, working 40 hours per
              week, and Irene as “keeping house” at a home along County Road C,
              with their first eight children at home.
            </p>

            <p>
              Together they raised <strong>nine children</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>William Henry Perry Jr.</strong> (1939–2015)</li>
              <li><strong>Edwin Stevens Perry</strong> (b. 1940)</li>
              <li><strong>John Alan Perry</strong> (1942–2025)</li>
              <li><strong>Garry Bruce Perry</strong> (1944–2007)</li>
              <li><strong>Nancy Jane Marie Perry</strong> (b. 1945)</li>
              <li><strong>Gladys Arlene Perry</strong> (b. 1947)</li>
              <li><strong>Joyce Ellen Perry</strong> (b. 1949)</li>
              <li><strong>Elizabeth Ann Perry</strong> (1950–2018)</li>
              <li><strong>Karen Lynn Perry</strong> (b. 1952)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In the late 1960s, William and Irene left the U.P. and moved to
              the Farwell area in Clare County, Michigan, where family stories
              recall them running a small gas station and store near a lake.
              William died in Farwell in March 1970 after a lifetime of mining
              work and is buried in Ishpeming Cemetery. Irene later lived for
              many years at 3220 Birchfield Drive in Midland, Michigan, before
              moving to live with daughters in Illinois and Lansing. She died in
              Lansing on 30 March 2006 at the age of 95 and is also buried in
              Ishpeming.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through William and Irene, the Perry family story connects Cornish
              mining heritage and Finnish immigrant roots with the iron ranges
              of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, a lakeside country store in
              mid-Michigan, and the many branches of their nine children and
              descendants.

            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Andrew Stevens Perry</strong> was born 24 February 1886 in
              <strong>Uny Lelant, Cornwall, England</strong>, to
              <strong>William Thomas Perry</strong> (1852–1904) and
              <strong>Elizabeth Ann (Stevens) Perry</strong> (1853–1901). He
              grew up in a Cornish mining family in a parish shaped by tin and
              copper mining, alongside siblings Selina, John, Mildred, Adelaide,
              and Thomas.
            </p>

            <p>
              In October 1899, 13-year-old Andrew left Cornwall with his family,
              sailing from England on the <em>St. Paul</em> and arriving in New
              York. By 1900 they were in Mahanoy City, Schuylkill County,
              Pennsylvania, in the anthracite coal region, where Andrew appears
              in the census as a slate picker in the mines. His mother died
              there in 1901 and his father in 1904, leaving the Perry children
              as young adult immigrants in a hard coal town.
            </p>

            <p>
              Andrew later moved to the iron ranges of northern Wisconsin and
              Michigan. On 2 September 1907 he married <strong>Annie Perry</strong>
              in Florence County, Wisconsin. Annie was born 10 September 1888 in
              <strong>Carmel, Putnam County, New York</strong>, to
              <strong>Henry James Perry</strong> (1859–1926) and
              <strong>Annie Jane (Roach) Perry</strong> (1866–1925). As a girl
              she moved with her family to Crystal Falls, Iron County, Michigan,
              where she appears in the 1900 census with siblings Elizabeth,
              Beatrice, Winifred, Thomas, Frances, and Gladys.
            </p>

            <p>
              Soon after their marriage Andrew and Annie settled in Crystal
              Falls, where Andrew worked as a blacksmith in the iron mines. The
              1910 census lists the young family under the surname
              <em>Derry</em>—a mis-reading of the Perry name—with “Andrew Derry”
              and “Annie Derry” recorded alongside sons Loyd R. and Raymond H.
              Later records, Michigan birth registrations, and Andrew’s death
              certificate confirm that this is the same family known as
              <strong>Perry</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Andrew and Annie had four children:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Richard Lloyd Perry</strong> (1908–1973)</li>
              <li><strong>William Henry Perry Sr.</strong> (1910–1970)</li>
              <li><strong>Jean Elizabeth Perry</strong> (later Wainio) (1912–1989)</li>
              <li><strong>Muriel Gladys Perry</strong> (later Anderson) (1914–1978)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Through the 1910s and 1920s, Andrew followed mining work across
              the Upper Peninsula. The family lived in Crystal Falls, the
              company village of Alpha, and later in Marquette. By 1930 they
              were at the Imperial Mine Location in Spurr Township, Baraga
              County, where Andrew was a naturalized English-born blacksmith at
              the mine, living in a rented company house with Annie and their
              children.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the late 1930s the family moved within the iron range again.
              City directories and the 1940 census place Andrew and Annie at
              <strong>140 Excelsior Street in Ishpeming</strong>, along with
              their daughter Jean, son William, daughter-in-law Irene, and
              grandson William Jr. Andrew died there on 23 April 1940 at age 54
              from a coronary occlusion and is buried in
              <strong>Ishpeming Cemetery</strong>. Annie remained in Ishpeming
              into the 1950s and later moved to New Jersey, where she died in
              December 1967 at Budd Lake, Morris County, and was buried at
              <strong>Stanhope Union Cemetery</strong> in Netcong.
            </p>

            <p>
              Andrew and Annie’s lives link Cornwall, New York, Pennsylvania
              coal country, and the iron mines of Michigan and Wisconsin. Their
              son William Henry Perry Sr. carried that story forward into the
              next generation.

              <strong>Jacob Nestor Hakala</strong> was born 8 July 1887 in
              <strong>Kauhajoki, Finland</strong>, to
              <strong>Jaakko Iisakinpoika Laurila</strong> and
              <strong>Hedda Sofia Samuelintytär Hangasluoma</strong>. He grew up
              in a large Finnish family with many brothers and sisters and
              emigrated from Finland around 1906–1907, part of a wave of young
              Finns leaving for North America.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Maria Eliina “Mary” (Oja) Hakala</strong> was born
              10 April 1891 in Finland to <strong>Anselm M. Oja</strong> and
              <strong>Louise (Lovisa) Kompse</strong>. As a child she emigrated
              with her parents and brother Alfred, appearing in the 1900 census
              in Ishpeming Ward 4 as <em>Elina Oie</em>, age eight, newly
              arrived from Finland and living on Daves Street. The Oja family
              later moved to the Princeton area of Forsyth Township in
              Marquette County.
            </p>

            <p>
              On 23 November 1908, Jacob and Maria were married in a ceremony
              recorded in Ishpeming and Negaunee. The marriage records list her
              parents as Anselm and Louise Oja and his parents as Jacob and
              “Hetafoya” Hakala, reflecting Finnish naming and spelling
              variations. After their marriage they settled in the Princeton /
              Forsyth area, where Jacob worked in the iron mines and on a small
              farm.

              repairman in an iron mine, working long weeks while owning a small
              farm. Maria is consistently listed as his wife, born in Finland
              and naturalized, “keeping house” and raising their large family.

              Jacob’s World War I draft registration lists him as
              <strong>Jacob Nester Hakala</strong>, born in “Finland, Russia,”
              of medium build with light brown hair and dark blue eyes, living
              in Marquette County. His World War II registration in 1942 gives
              his address as Princeton, with “Mrs. Maria Alena Hakala” as his
              next of kin.

              Maria’s parents, Anselm and Louise Oja, also made their home in
              Princeton, where Anselm died in 1928 and Louise in 1931. Maria
              died in Princeton on 2 March 1955. Jacob died two years later, on
              31 August 1957. Both are buried at <strong>Bakkala Cemetery</strong>
              in Forsyth Township, a small rural cemetery along M-35 that holds
              many local Finnish families. Maria’s grave appears in cemetery
              records as <strong>Maria Eluna Hakala</strong>, maiden name Oja.

              Through Jacob and Maria, the Perry reunion connects back to the
              Finnish countryside around Kauhajoki and to the Finnish-American
              communities of Princeton and Forsyth. Their daughter Irene joined
              that story to the Perry line when she married William Henry
              Perry Sr. in 1939.
